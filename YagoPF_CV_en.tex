%My name is Yago Fernández Pinilla and I am writing to you regarding the \textit{Software Support Engineer (Service Manager)} position at your office in Göteborg. I found the job advertisement at your website and was instantly attracted by the position offered by your company. I believe that my academic background and previous professional experience make me a highly suitable candidate for this position.

%My coursework as a Computer Engineer at University of A Coru\~{n}a (Spain) has exposed me to an extensive set of programming experiences with different kind of projects, environments and technologies. Among others, I have completed courses in low-level programming, courses of designing standalone applications, web applications and service oriented applications using different languages and techniques with good results. After finishing my studies I moved to Sweden looking for an international environment to work in and continue my career. I am currently working as a Computer Engineer at Gridcore AB as part of the development team. Our team works on solutions for several customers used in different cloud environments. Working in this company has improved my general knowledge in this field, increased the number of programming languages that I know (C++, Python), improved the ones I already knew (Java, C, HTML, Bash), knowledge of OS (Linux, Unix, OSX, Windows) and many different tools (Cassandra, Postgres, RabbitMQ). As part of the development team my tasks were different depending on the project and the situation. On one side my responsabilities included design, code and debug applications using different programming languages, techniques and tools. But on the other side my job required direct contact with clients and communication skills. Listening to clients’ needs, assisting them with new products and features or offering technical support of any kind where some of my responsibilities. Another task was a previous investigation, test and benchmarking before the use of any third-party tool as part of a project.

%In addition to my technical skills, I think that my personal skills qualify me to work in your company. I am an easygoing, diligent, driven and a focused person. I am motivated to work in a group of people where I can collaborate and learn from my colleagues, as well as I am also comfortable working individually. My experience gained from working  teaching adults and children enhanced my communication skills and creative mindset. This affects me in a positive way and also my way of working. I am passionate about everything involving technology and learning new things, always reading about other projects and attending to conferences to keep up to date.

%Thank you for taking your time to go through my application. When I found this job advertisement I knew that this will be a great opportunity for me, combining all my passions and professional experience, in a company where I know I want to work.  I would love the opportunity to discuss the position and my candidacy with you. If references or further information are needed, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
